  MappingScheduler.h: implements a thread in which mapping actions are
  performed. Each Mapping object implements a triggerReceived() method
  which is called by the hardware I/O thread. This method should do a
  minimal amount of work but pass the real work off to the performMapping()
  method which is called by the MappingScheduler thread. The scheduler
  also allows mapping calls to be performed in the absence of received data,
  for example to cause a parameter to ramp down over time if no touch data
  is received.
